                    <p>Hello! My name is Juana Bustamante, I am currently in the final year of my Bachelor's Degree in Bilingualism with an Emphasis in English. Over the past two years, I have gained valuable experience in translation work and personalized English teaching, which has deepened my expertise in language and education. Alongside my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in a research project examining the use of ICT in public education settings and its impact on pedagogical practices.

                        In addition to my work in education and research, I am also pursuing studies in coding and programming. I am currently focused on Python, exploring its applications in data analysis and development, while also expressing a keen interest in expanding my skills to include JavaScript. My dual commitment to research and programming enables me to approach educational challenges with innovative solutions and a technical perspective.</p>
